# Global Healthcare Costs and Outcomes

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a website that compares **United States healthcare costs** to other countries, while also comparing **health outcomes** (such as life expectancy, mortality rates, etc.). The project provides a transparent view of healthcare spending vs health outcomes and allows users to interact with and explore the data.

## Goals
1. **Compare U.S. healthcare costs** with those of other countries.
2. **Compare health outcomes** such as life expectancy, infant mortality, and other indicators globally.
3. Provide **interactive visualizations** to easily digest the data.
4. Allow users to **compare countries** based on healthcare costs and outcomes.

## Features
- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and maps that display healthcare costs and health outcomes across countries.
- **Country Comparison Tool**: Users can compare U.S. healthcare statistics against selected countries.
- **Rankings and Insights**: Rank countries by their healthcare spending and outcomes and highlight key outliers.
- **Transparent Data Sources**: All data is pulled from credible sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank, and OECD.

## Current Status
We are currently in the process of **defining the scope of the project** and **gathering and cleaning data**. As the project evolves, additional steps and features will be added.
